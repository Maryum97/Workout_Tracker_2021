## üîç Description
This repository contains the homework assignment conducted through the teaching facilities of the Univesity of Birmingham, in the third phase of the Coding Bootcamp; a web application by the name "Workout Tracker". This web application is very useful to people who wish to keep track of their exercise plans, for a healthier and more organised lifestyle in their goald to become fitter.

This app allows the user to add a new workout plan, either resistance or cardio; once selected, the user is able to set their stats and view them on the homepage ('Fitness Tracker'). In the 'Dashboard' page, the user is able to view their overall activity over time, in terms of stats; the graph and chart on the left show the duration of workout over a week (resistance); The ones on the right show weights lifted over a week (cardio).

Here is the link to the deployed application on <b>Heroku</b>:

The application is connected with <b>Atlas</b>, where all the entries are stored, and may be added, edited or deleted from.

## üíæ Installation
In order to install the app, you can simply gain access to this repository and clone it after having installed the following applications on your local device:

1. VS Code
2. Git Bash/Terminal
3. Robo3T
4. Node.js

## ‚öôÔ∏è Instructions
After installing the above, run the following commands in the local terminal in VS Code:

> // to install the node modules 
> npm install

<br></br>

> // to seed the database 
> node seeders/seed.js

<br></br>

> // to run the server in the browser 
> node server.js

<br></br>

Now open the app in the browser, by searching for 'localhost:8000'. Feel free to use the app locally and enjoy!

Ypu can also open Robo3T and connect to view all entries in the 'workout' database.

## üíª Usage
The application is very simple in terms of usage. All you have to do is to click onn the link above, land on the Fitness Tracker page, and click on the New Wrokout button. The page renders a form, where you may select any of the two options shown in the image below:

<br></br>

Clicking then on the Complete button will redirect you to the landing page, where the stats for the last exercise are visible as well, as shown below:

<br></br>

Then, once the form is complete, click on the Add Exercise button - a green message appears on the top right corner of the screen, signalling that the exercise has been included into the Dashboard. The Dashboard page must now show the stats for your exercise in the form of graphs and chart, as shown in the image below:

## ‚úèÔ∏è Tests
There were no particular test that this app has been made to pass, except for the app to flow error-free in the local terminal and in the browser, with all the correct packages and libraries installed, the database seeded (if running locally), the Heroku app connected to the Atlas account (if running publically), and the server running at all times of use.
